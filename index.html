          <em><strong>Nope</strong></em> is a film I saw later in its release
          window due to hearing of audience disappointment on the net. I hear
          their criticisms but I am honestly so glad I did not miss out on this
          one. Jordan Peele in an interview stated he was out to make a
          spectacle and he delivered on that front. The film also has some to
          say about spectacle. Without spoiling too much, Nope is a blast of a
          cinematic experience with top-tier camera-work and creative visuals,
          and let's not forget the great characters either. Is there a lot of
          unanswered questions? Sure. Is there a lot that doesn't make a ton of
          sense? Sure, so focus on the well-done aspects of the film and you'll
          come out happy.

          <em><strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong></em
          >... What a movie, movie of the year. The less you know about it
          before going into it the better. The way in which its concept is
          executed is highly refreshing. I laughed in this film more than I have
          in maybe any other. Some very off-the-wall sequences. A lot of
          references. But most of all, a beautiful heart. Think, the creativity
          and the immersiveness of the Matrix, and the heart of Encanto.

          <em><strong>Encanto</strong></em
          >! I work with children. I heard them singing the songs of Encanto
          before I came around to watching it. I am not a fan of Frozen, not
          very much a Disney fan. But I love how this film focuses on family
          dynamic. Some might be disappointed that its scale is small, but it
          makes it a more intimate piece. Great story, great visuals, the voice
          actress of Mirabel is fantastic. The whole cast is fantastic. I say
          Moana is the navigator... steering Disney in a good direction. Encanto
          and before, Coco, have taken Moana but with more focus on the family
          with a better set of conflicts, unless you like action.

          <em><strong>Primal</strong></em> is not a movie... Actually,
          nevermind! It is now, its really just its first four episodes strung
          together. One word: phenomenal. An absolutely brutal world, follows
          travails of human and dinosaur. How was their bond forged, how does it
          remain? So, so touching, and truly made me a little more grateful for
          what I have in my life. Strong is the spirit that has weathered many
          tragedies.
